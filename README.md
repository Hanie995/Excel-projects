# Excel-projects
Here I have put all the functions and data visualisation skills that I have in Excel. I have done 10 real-world projects to show how to: 
- enter data,
- navigate through a spreadsheet,
- create formulas to solve problems,
- create charts and graphs,
- understand relative vs absolute references,
- import and export data,
- implement VLOOKUP,
- use pivot tables,
- split and concatenate text, 
- and more.
This was an Excel tutorial that I followed on YouTube.
